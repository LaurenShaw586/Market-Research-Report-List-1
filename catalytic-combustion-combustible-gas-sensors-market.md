<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Catalytic Combustion Combustible Gas Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Defusion</li><li>Inhalation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Catalytic combustion combustible gas sensors are critical in detecting flammable gases by employing two main market types: diffusion and inhalation. Diffusion sensors passively allow gas to permeate through a membrane, enabling continuous monitoring without mechanical assistance. Inhalation sensors, on the other hand, actively draw gas into the sensor through a pump, providing rapid and precise measurements. Both types are essential for safety in industrial, residential, and commercial settings, ensuring timely detection of hazardous gas leaks.</p></p>
